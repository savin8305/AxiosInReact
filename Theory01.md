`React Axios`
##### In React JS, Axios is a library that serves to create HTTP requests (API) that are present externally.
##### In React JS, It is evident from the fact that we may sometimes in React applications need to get data from the external source.
##### In React JS, It is quite difficult to fetch such data so that they can be normally shown on the website.
##### In React JS, Axios is a HTTP client library that allows you to make requests to a given endpoint.
##### In React JS, Many projects on the web need to interface with a REST API at some stage in their development.
##### In React JS, Axios is a lightweight HTTP client based on the $http service within Angular js version 1 and is similar to the native JavaScript Fetch API.
##### In React JS, Axios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScript’s async and await for more readable asynchronous code.
##### In React JS, You can also intercept and cancel requests, and there’s built-in client-side protection against cross-site request forgery (attacks).
##### Additionally, react Axios is very easy to modify and is quite lightweight.
##### In React JS, AXIOS also works great with many other frameworks present today.
##### In React JS, The main purpose of using Axios is to get support for request and response interception, conversion of data into JSON format, and transform it.
##### AXIOS also helps you in protecting XSRF forgery by default while you request cross-site access.
`Why Use Axios in React ?`
##### Here are most important five reasons why you should use Axios as your client to make HTTP requests:

##### AXIOS has good defaults to work with JSON data. Unlike alternatives such as the Fetch API, you often don’t need to set your headers. Or perform tedious tasks like converting your request body to a JSON string.
##### React Axios has function names that match any HTTP methods. To perform a GET request, you use the .get() method.
##### React Axios does more with less code. Unlike the Fetch API, you only need one .then() callback to access your requested JSON data.
##### React Axios has better error handling. Axios throws 400 and 500 range errors for you. Unlike the Fetch API, where you have to check the status code and throw the error yourself.
##### React Axios can be used on the server as well as the client. If you are writing a Node.js application, be aware that Axios can also be used in an environment separate from the browser.
