`React Axios`
#### In React JS, Axios is a library that serves to create HTTP requests (API) that are present externally.
#### In React JS, It is evident from the fact that we may sometimes in React applications need to get data from the external source.
#### In React JS, It is quite difficult to fetch such data so that they can be normally shown on the website.
#### In React JS, Axios is a HTTP client library that allows you to make requests to a given endpoint.
#### In React JS, Many projects on the web need to interface with a REST API at some stage in their development.
#### In React JS, Axios is a lightweight HTTP client based on the $http service within Angular js version 1 and is similar to the native JavaScript Fetch API.
#### In React JS, Axios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScript’s async and await for more readable asynchronous code.
#### In React JS, You can also intercept and cancel requests, and there’s built-in client-side protection against cross-site request forgery (attacks).
#### Additionally, react Axios is very easy to modify and is quite lightweight.
#### In React JS, AXIOS also works great with many other frameworks present today.
#### In React JS, The main purpose of using Axios is to get support for request and response interception, conversion of data into JSON format, and transform it.
